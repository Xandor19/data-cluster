# data-cluster
Creation of a Kubernetes-based cluster for data processing

## Project scopes

Conventional commits are used as the commit messages template. The scopes are defined by the different setup scenarios (system, tools, etc...). Each scope contains both the guides and automation scripts provided for the utility. Currently:

- system: OS preparation steps. Includes commands and setups only related with the OS itself, and system.related commands required to setup an specific tool are included within the scope of that tool

> [!NOTE]
>
> As setup Markdowns explaining the steps to configure a scope include the required commands and logic, these are marked within the scripts as "feat" changes
